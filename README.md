# Cypress_Tests
Just some of the tests I created using Cypress. This is a tiny example of the scripts I've created.


testFiles.txt lists each of the scripts that I used in my regular regression.

ccUtils.js is something I wrote (gleaned using Google) to cycle through the test credit cards from Stripe (read: they won't work in the real world)
